// Pure map-mode / lock-flag / dirty-range logic for vertex and index
// buffers, factored out of d3d9_buffer.cpp so it carries no device or Metal
// include surface. References: DXVK
// d3d9_common_buffer.h, DXVK d3d9_device.cpp, wined3d buffer.c.

namespace dxmt {

// THE STORAGE CONTRACT: no page the application writes is ever referenced by a
// command buffer. Every buffer is staged. Lock returns a host mirror we own and
// Metal has never seen; the allocation a draw reads is Metal-owned, never
// handed out, and is refreshed from that mirror.
//
// The condition is stated in terms of what the GPU USES rather than what Metal
// has been told about, because that is what the livelock below turns on, and
// because one path relies on the difference: a texture's MANAGED mirror is
// wrapped in a Metal buffer at d3d9_texture.cpp ensureMirror so the device
// backing pool can hold a single reference type. That buffer is written to the
// texture's fields and never bound, never blitted from or to; uploads go
// through the ring and readback writes the CPU backing. Wrapping alone does not
// wire a page. If a future change ever gives the GPU work that reads it, the
// pages the application writes become wired and this contract is broken.
//
// DXVK's DetermineMapMode (d3d9_common_buffer.cpp) sends DEFAULT+DYNAMIC down
// its allowDirectBufferMapping arm instead, aliasing the Lock pointer onto the
// backing queued draws read in place, and we followed that shape until two
// platform facts ruled it out.
//
// First, such a pointer livelocks. Once the GPU has used the wrapping buffer
// its pages are wired, and a store from translated code into a wired page that
// carries translation state is rejected and re-executed at fault-service
// cadence for as long as the wrap lives: 5,979 ns per store, against 0.25 ns
// for the same store once any one of those conditions is absent. The
// application is the one writer whose pages cannot be vetted, and it keeps
// writing after Unlock, so there is no window in which handing it wrapped
// memory is safe.
//
// Second, the alternative that would avoid the wrap is unreachable here.
// Aliasing memory Metal itself allocates is what DXVK effectively does through
// Vulkan, but Metal allocates above 4 GB in practice, so a 32-bit guest cannot
// address it. Giving that guest a lock pointer at all requires wrapping pages
// it can address, which is exactly the livelock. The divergence from DXVK is
// forced by the address space, not chosen.
//
// Staging costs one copy per refresh, which on unified memory is DRAM
// bandwidth rather than a transfer, and it buys back guest address space: the
// allocation a draw reads is Metal-owned and charges none, where in-place
// renames charged it per allocation in flight. Should a native or 64-bit guest
// ever remove both premises, shared-storage direct mapping becomes the correct
// answer again and this is the comment to re-examine.

// SizeToLock IS NOT TRACKED, deliberately. The runtime hands back
// base + OffsetToLock and validates nothing, and shipped titles lock a small
// window then write far past it: one such title lost 233,077 of 524,288 index
// bytes that way, rendering a black world with no error anywhere. Windows
// tolerates it because the system-memory copy the application writes IS the
// buffer there, so a write outside the announced window still reaches the draw.
// Applications also keep writing after Unlock, which no bookkeeping finalised at
// Unlock can survive. So a write lock marks the buffer dirty and nothing more;
// what a draw reads is decided from the draw, not from what the lock announced.
//
// Whether a Lock dirties the buffer at all. Post-sanitisation flags, so
// READONLY here is already the effective (MANAGED-only) flag.
// D3DLOCK_NO_DIRTY_UPDATE is a texture-only flag: D3D9 buffers always mark a
// write-lock dirty regardless of it (wined3d buffer.c invalidates on any write
// map and never consults the flag; only the texture map path checks it).
