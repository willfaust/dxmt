// the `d9 layer extent` line in d3d9_swapchain.cpp. It was behind
// DXMT_D9_PRESENTDBG, so every device log taken so far is silent about the
// one number that decides it, and two rounds of reading could not rule the
// present path in or out. It is deduped to one line per distinct
// (window, drawable, backbuffer) triple, so a stable configuration emits a
